This is a FrontEndMentor challenge that I worked on consisting of HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript. I wrote the JS in a way that would best emulate a real-world scenario of rendering content from a database onto the main page. The data.js file contains an array of objects that are rendered onto the page via the execution of the "renderItems" function, which conditionally renders the items and their corresponding CSS elements. I got a bit lazy on the CSS for the mobile view, therefore, it's not exact but it is still functional. This was a pretty enjoyable challenge. Please feel free to look over the code and use it to your liking.
